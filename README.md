# color-palettes
Uses jQuery/UI to create and group logical color-palettes.
The background-color of each color-palette acts as a base color. Further colors
can be dragged and removed from the base color-palette to make comparisons and
generate best matches.

Base color-palette background-colors are automatically updated with their actual
hex value upon the event of editable text, as well as adjusting the lighten and
darken property of the hex.
